    "## Introdunction\n",
    "Exisiting autonoumous driving controls assume that the users of the autonoumous driving system prefer the similar pattern, in practical scenarios, this is rarely the case. This paper introduces Risk Sensative Control (RSC), an inverse optimal control algorithm that is able to estimate the risk sensative driving features, and incorporate those features online into a receding-horizon cotroller. RSC solves the inverse optimal control problem by reducing subjective risk perseption from users feedback. RSC uses an Meta-learning algorithm to update the parameters of the cost function parameters, and  improve the controller online as more data is gathered from the users subjective risk feedback. The estimater take acounts of the uncertainty in the subjective risk analysis in driving features and surroudning vehicle locations, by uncertainty ellipse constraints. This approach is verified in realtime in five lane change both safe and risky scenarios in CARLA simulation environments.\n"

    "### Objective Function Estimation\n",
    "Estimating objective functions from historical data is a well investigated problem known as Inverse Optimal Control\n",
    "(IOC) or Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL). Typically, with the IRL approach, the objective function is linear in\n",
    "terms of a given set of state features. The goal is to identify a parameter vector that weights these features so that\n",
    "the behavior resulting from this estimated objective matches the observed behavior. \n",
    "Optimal control methods are optimizers, but in reality, we don’t really know what we should be optimizing. The question of how we can, instead, leverage our strong intuition of how we’d like the robot to behave to learn a cost function that embodies demonstrations of that behavior. So defines Inverse Optimal Control (IOC). Rather than computing an optimal policy given a cost function, IOC uncovers the cost function that best explains demonstrated optimal behavior. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Online Parameter Estimation\n",
    "We review approaches proposed for online parameter estimation in this context. The Intelligent Driver Model (IDM), is a rule-based lane-following model balancing two objectives: reaching a desired speed and avoiding collision with\n",
    "the preceding car. This model has few tunable parameters and returns the scalar acceleration of the vehicle along a predefined\n",
    "path. Several works used online filtering techniques to estimate these IDM parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data-Driven driving Control\n",
    "There is a rich literature on applying data-driven approaches\n",
    "to pedestrian or vehicle trajectory predictions. Such approaches usually require a large corpus of data and are trained\n",
    "offline as a general model to suit multiple agents. On the other hand, we require a small amount of data and find parameters\n",
    "online for a specific agent. Data-driven methods can predict a distribution over future trajectories e.g., offline inverse optimal\n",
    "control with online goal inference; Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAE) or Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). "
